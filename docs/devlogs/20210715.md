# Electron Bug in Ubuntu 20.04 (Wayland)

## Bug Root
Before Electron 12 came along, which integrated Wayland support, window with `transparent: true` in lower version can not display properly.

## Background Description
So the app I am developing has a screenshot feature, the idea is when the capture event triggered, use a fullscreen window with transparent background(of the window, not the page background), to capture screenshot.

The image source came from `const { desktopCapturer } = require('electron')`, take a single frame(the first frame) of the video stream, and using canvas to draw it out on the fullscreen window.

After retrive image data from canvas, then give back to user with edit feature enabled, corp, texted, decorated, and so on...

## Bug Analyze
The problem is that only Electron >= 12 integrated with Wayland support.

And old method of creating the mainWindow is no longer working, cause I guess is that rendering transparent fullscreen window needs time to processing data.

```javascript
  // app.whenReady().then(createWindow) // change it to setTimeout(callback)
  app.whenReady().then(() => setTimeout(createWindow, 500))
```

And then comes to linux graphics support...

```javascript
  app.disableHardwareAcceleration() // used on X11.
```

```javascript
  // app.disableHardwareAcceleration()
  app.appendSwitch('use-gl', 'desktop') // used on Wayland
  app.appendArgument('disable-gpu')
```
