# Why is scoped-style in Vue3 not Working

Today I ran into this strange issue, let's see the code first.

## Code 1
```html
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Menu } from 'ant-design-vue'; // version 3.x
</script>

<template>
  <Menu>
</template>

<style scoped>
.ant-menu {
  background: #000;
}
</style>
```

## Code 2
```html
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Menu } from 'ant-design-vue'; // version 3.x
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <Menu>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.ant-menu {
  background: #000;
}
</style>
```

## What's the Difference between Code 1 and Code 2 ???

Initially, I wrote my code as _Code 1_, but the style is not applyed to the _Menu_ component,
where in _Code 2_, it worked.

## My Guess

Normally, when use `scoped` in style block, _@vue/sfc-compiler_ will generate a `data-v-xxxx` as component_id, and binding it into the component,
and your style block will also be translated into `.ant-menu[data-v-xxxx] {...}`, this process worked in _Code 2_ and you can find `data-v-xxxx` in `<div>` tag.

But for some reason, when using `Menu` directly under the root `template`, this component_id is not attached to `Menu`.



[TODO] need to sleep now.
